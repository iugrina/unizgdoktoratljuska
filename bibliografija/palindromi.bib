	abstract = {Certain {DNA} sequence motifs and structures can promote genomic instability. We have explored instability induced in mouse cells by long inverted repeats ({LIRs).} A cassette was constructed containing a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene into which was inserted an {LIR} composed of two inverted copies of a 1.1-kb yeast {URA3} gene sequence separated by a 200-bp spacer sequence. The tk gene was introduced into the genome of mouse Ltk(-) fibroblasts either by itself or in conjunction with a closely linked tk gene that was disrupted by an 8-bp {XhoI} linker insertion; rates of intrachromosomal homologous recombination between the markers were determined. Recombination between the two tk alleles was stimulated 5-fold by the {LIR}, as compared to a long direct repeat ({LDR)} insert, resulting in nearly 10(-5) events per cell per generation. Of the tk(+) segregants recovered from {LIR-containing} cell lines, 14\% arose from gene conversions that eliminated the {LIR}, as compared to 3\% of the tk(+) segregants from {LDR} cell lines, corresponding to a {\textgreater}20-fold increase in deletions at the {LIR} hotspot. Thus, an {LIR}, which is a common motif in mammalian genomes, is at risk for the stimulation of homologous recombination and possibly other genetic rearrangements.},

	abstract = {Chromosomes of many eukaryotic organisms including humans contain a large number of repetitive sequences. Several types of commonly present {DNA} repeats have the capacity to adopt hairpin and cruciform secondary structures. Inverted repeats, {AT-} and {GC-rich} micro- and minisatellites, comprising this class of sequence motifs, are frequently found in chromosomal regions that are prone for gross rearrangements in somatic and germ cells. Recent studies in yeast and mammals indicate that a double-strand break occurring at the sites of unstable repeats can be an initial event in the generation of chromosome rearrangements. The repeat-induced chromosomal instability is responsible for a number of human diseases and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which hairpins and cruciforms can trigger chromosomal fragility and subsequent aberrations in eukaryotic cells. We also address the relationship between secondary structure-mediated genetic instability and human pathology.},

	abstract = {During the last several years, substantial progress has been made in developing high-throughput experimental techniques that produce large amounts of genomic data pertaining to molecular activities in cells. Consequently, a great deal of research is being focused on addressing important problems in molecular biology by analyzing these data using mathematical and computational approaches. Genomic signal processing has been an active area of research for the past two decades and have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers from digital signal processing area all over the world. An important step in genomic annotation is to identify protein coding regions of {DNA} sequence especially in the study of eukaryotic genomes. Due to lack of obvious sequence features among exons and introns, distinguishing protein coding regions from non-coding regions effectively is a challenging problem. A variety of computational algorithms have been developed to predict exons. Most of the exon finding algorithms are based on statistics methods. The signal processing approaches of recent years may identify some hidden periodicity and features which can not be revealed easily by conventional statistics methods. In this paper the authors have presented an algorithm to separate out coding regions from non-coding regions based on positional frequency distribution of nucleotides and the algorithm shows the results that exon regions exhibit more random behavior compared to intron regions. Such a behavior was also observed by {FFT} power spectrum analysis of {DNA} sequences. Case studies on genes from different organisms show that the algorithm is an effective approach towards exon prediction.},

	abstract = {A perfect palindromic 66-base pair (bp) {DNA} sequence derived from the lac operator and cloned into plasmid {pMB9} [Betz, J. L. \& Sadler, J. R. (1981) Gene 13, 1-12] can exist in a 66-bp linear form or as two 33-bp cruciform arms. The fraction of the sequence in the cruciform depends on the superhelical density of the plasmid {DNA.} Relaxed {DNA} contains no cruciforms. The palindrome in the cruciform structure is cut by {EcoRI} endonuclease at the base of the cruciform arms, releasing 33-bp fragments; when in the linear form only 66-bp fragments are produced. The cruciform structure is fixed by trimethylpsoralen crosslinks in the cruciform arms. This together with the {EcoRI} cutting provides an assay for the cruciform structures in the {DNA} of living cells. Using this assay we show that the cruciform structure rarely if ever exists in vivo, but after {DNA} isolation greater than 90\% of the sequence is in cruciforms. Results suggest that the plasmid {DNA} as organized in vivo either lacks sufficient torsional tension to form this cruciform or the palindrome is restrained in the linear form by other bound molecules.},

	volume = {146},

	abstract = {Palindromic sequences have the potential to form hairpin or cruciform structures, which are putative substrates for several nucleases and mismatch repair enzymes. A genetic method was developed to detect such structures in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this method we previously showed that short hairpin structures are poorly repaired by the mismatch repair system in S. cerevisiae. We show here that mismatches, when present in the stem of the hairpin structure, are not processed by the repair machinery, suggesting that they are treated differently than those in the interstrand base-paired duplex {DNA.} A 140-bp-long palindromic sequence, on the contrary, acts as a meiotic recombination hotspot by generating a site for a double-strand break, an initiator of meiotic recombination. We suggest that long palindromic sequences undergo cruciform extrusion more readily than short ones. This cruciform structure then acts as a substrate for structure-specific nucleases resulting in the formation of a double-strand break during meiosis in yeast. In addition, we show that residual repair of the short hairpin structure occurs in an {MSH2-independent} pathway.},

	abstract = {{ADR1} is a transcription factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that regulates {ADH2} expression through a 22-bp palindromic sequence ({UAS1).} Size fractionation studies revealed that full-length {ADR1} and a truncated {ADR1} protein containing the first 229 amino acids, which has the complete {DNA-binding} domain, {ADR1:17-229}, exist as monomers in solution. However, two complexes were formed with target {DNA-binding} sites. {UV-cross-linking} studies suggested that these two complexes represent one and two molecules of {ADR1} bound to {DNA.} Studies of {ADR1} complexes formed with wild-type {UAS1}, asymmetrically altered {UAS1}, and one half of {UAS1} showed that {ADR1} can bind to one half of {UAS1} and gives rise to a complex containing one molecule of {ADR1.} Dimethyl sulfate interference studies were consistent with this interpretation and in addition indicated that purine contact sites in each half of {UAS1} were identical. Increasing the distance between the two halves of {UAS1} had at most a minor effect of the thermodynamics of formation of the two complexes. These data are more consistent with {ADR1} binding as two independent monomers, one to each half of {UAS1.} However, binding of two {ADR1} monomers at {UAS1} is apparently essential for transactivation in vivo. Further, we have identified a stretch of 18 amino acid residues amino terminal to the zinc two-finger domains of {ADR1} which is essential for {DNA-binding} activity. Single amino acid substitutions of residues in this region resulted in severely reduced {DNA-binding} activity.},

In order to initiate a systematic study of palindromes at the whole genome level, we developed a computer program that can identify, locate and count palindromes in a given sequence in a strictly defined way. All palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats without spacer {DNA}, can be analyzed and sorted according to their size, frequency, {GC} content or alphabetically. This program was then used to prepare a catalog of all palindromes present in the chromosomal {DNA} of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each palindrome size, the observed palindrome counts were significantly different from those in the randomly generated equivalents of the yeast genome. However, while the short palindromes (2-12 bp) were under-represented, the palindromes longer than 12 bp were over-represented, {AT-rich} and preferentially located in the intergenic regions. The 44-bp palindrome found between the genes {CDC53} and {LYS21} on chromosome {IV} was the longest palindrome identified and contained only two C-G base pairs. Avoidance of coding regions was also observed for palindromes of 4-12 bp, but was less pronounced. Dinucleotide analysis indicated a strong bias against palindromic dinucleotides that could explain the observed short palindrome avoidance. We discuss some possible mechanisms that may influence the evolutionary dynamics of palindromic sequences in the yeast genome.},

	abstract = {Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium of major public health significance, infecting over one-tenth of the world’s population and causing blindness and infertility in millions. Mounting evidence supports recombination as a key source of genetic diversity among free-living bacteria. Previous research shows that intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydiaceae may also undergo recombination but whether this plays a significant evolutionary role has not been determined. Here, we examine multiple loci dispersed throughout the chromosome to determine the extent and significance of recombination among 19 laboratory reference strains and 10 present-day ocular and urogenital clinical isolates using phylogenetic reconstructions, compatibility matrices, and statistically based recombination programs. Recombination is widespread; all clinical isolates are recombinant at multiple loci with no two belonging to the same clonal lineage. Several reference strains show nonconcordant phylogenies across loci; one strain is unambiguously identified as recombinantly derived from other reference strain lineages. Frequent recombination contrasts with a low level of point substitution; novel substitutions relative to reference strains occur less than one per kilobase. Hotspots for recombination are identified downstream from {ompA}, which encodes the major outer membrane protein. This widespread recombination, unexpected for an intracellular bacterium, explains why strain-typing using one or two genes, such as {ompA}, does not correlate with clinical phenotypes. Our results do not point to specific events that are responsible for different pathogenicities but, instead, suggest a new approach to dissect the genetic basis for clinical strain pathology with implications for evolution, host cell adaptation, and emergence of new chlamydial diseases.},

In this paper, we investigate nucleotide variation across an averaged representation of all known human genes. Such a representation allows us to average out random fluctuations that constitute noise and uncover remarkable systematic trends in nucleotide distributions, particularly near boundaries between genetic elements—the promoter, exons, and introns. We propose that such variations result from differential mutational pressures and from the presence of specific regulatory motifs, such as transcription and splicing factor binding sites. Specifically, we observe significant {GC} and {TA} biases (excess of G over C and T over A) in noncoding regions of genes. Such biases are most probably caused by transcription-coupled mismatch repair, an effect that has recently been detected in mammalian genes. Subsequently, we examine the distribution of all hexanucleotides and identify motifs that are overrepresented within regulatory regions. By clustering and aligning such sequences, we recognize families of putative regulatory elements involved in exonic and intronic splicing control, and 3′ {mRNA} processing. Some of our motifs have been identified in prior theoretical and experimental studies, thus validating our approach, but we detect several novel sequences that we propose as candidates for future functional assays and mutation screens for genetic disorders.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2474621/},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-9-274},
	abstract = {Background
It has been previously shown that palindromic sequences are frequently observed in proteins. However, our knowledge about their evolutionary origin and their possible importance is incomplete.

Results
In this work, we tried to revisit this relatively neglected phenomenon. Several questions are addressed in this work. (1) It is known that there is a large chance of finding a palindrome in low complexity sequences (i.e. sequences with extreme amino acid usage bias). What is the role of sequence complexity in the evolution of palindromic sequences in proteins? (2) Do palindromes coincide with conserved protein sequences? If yes, what are the functions of these conserved segments? (3) In case of conserved palindromes, is it always the case that the whole conserved pattern is also symmetrical? (4) Do palindromic protein sequences form regular secondary structures? (5) Does sequence similarity of the two "sides" of a palindrome imply structural similarity? For the first question, we showed that the complexity of palindromic peptides is significantly lower than randomly generated palindromes. Therefore, one can say that palindromes occur frequently in low complexity protein segments, without necessarily having a defined function or forming a special structure. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility of finding palindromes which play some roles in protein structure and function. In fact, we found several palindromes that overlap with conserved protein Blocks of different functions. However, in many cases we failed to find any symmetry in the conserved regions of corresponding Blocks. Furthermore, to answer the last two questions, the structural characteristics of palindromes were studied. It is shown that palindromes may have a great propensity to form α-helical structures. Finally, we demonstrated that the two sides of a palindrome generally do not show significant structural similarities.

Conclusion
We suggest that the puzzling abundance of palindromic sequences in proteins is mainly due to their frequent concurrence with low-complexity protein regions, rather than a global role in the protein function. In addition, palindromic sequences show a relatively high tendency to form helices, which might play an important role in the evolution of proteins that contain palindromes. Moreover, reverse similarity in peptides does not necessarily imply significant structural similarity. This observation rules out the importance of palindromes for forming symmetrical structures. Although palindromes frequently overlap with conserved Blocks, we suggest that palindromes overlap with Blocks only by coincidence, rather than being involved with a certain structural fold or protein domain.},

	doi = {10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645223},
	abstract = {Accurate prediction of genes in genomes has always been a challenging task for bioinformaticians and computational biologists. Therefore, the discovery of relations in coding and non-coding sequences has led to new perspectives in the understanding of the {DNA} sequences. This has motivated us to find new methods to distinguish coding and non-coding sequences. We first introduce a number sequence representation of {DNA} sequences. Multi-affinity analysis and local Hölder exponent are then performed on the representation of the obtained number sequence. Three suited exponents are selected to form a parameter space. The two exponents γ(-2), γ(6) are from Multi-affinity analysis, the exponent h is from local Hölder exponent. Thus, each coding or non-coding sequence may be represented by a point in the three-dimensional parameter space. We can see the points corresponding to coding and non-coding sequences in the complete genome of many prokaryotes be divided to different regions roughly. If the point (γ(-2), γ(6), h) for a {DNA} sequence is situated in the region corresponding to coding sequences, the sequence is discriminated as a coding sequence; otherwise, the sequence is classified as a non-coding one. Therefore these exponents can be used to distinguish coding and non-coding sequences. The Fisher's discriminant algorithm is used to give the discriminant accuracies. The average discriminant accuracies pc, pnc, qc and qnc of all 51 prokaryotes obtained by the present method reach 69.08\%, 83.34\%, 72.08\% and 83.54\%, respectively.},

Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in β-type but not α- or γ-type human herpesviruses featuring G {\textgreater} C downstream of {oriL} and C {\textgreater} G upstream of {oriL.} Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.},

	abstract = {One of the major goals of computational sequence analysis is to find sequence similarities, which could serve as evidence of structural and functional conservation, as well as of evolutionary relations among the sequences. Since the degree of similarity is usually assessed by the sequence alignment score, it is necessary to know if a score is high enough to indicate a biologically interesting alignment. A powerful approach to defining score cutoffs is based on the evaluation of the statistical significance of alignments. The statistical significance of an alignment score is frequently assessed by its P-value, which is the probability that this score or a higher one can occur simply by chance, given the probabilistic models for the sequences. In this review we discuss the general role of P-value estimation in sequence analysis, and give a description of theoretical methods and computational approaches to the estimation of statistical signifiance for important classes of sequence analysis problems. In particular, we concentrate on the P-value estimation techniques for single sequence studies (both score-based and score-free), global and local pairwise sequence alignments, multiple alignments, sequence-to-profile alignments and alignments built with hidden Markov models. We anticipate that the review will be useful both to researchers professionally working in bioinformatics as well as to biomedical scientists interested in using contemporary methods of {DNA} and protein sequence analysis.},

Due to the incorporation of both strands of the {DNA} molecules and explicit modeling of dependencies between overlapping hits, we achieve accurate results for any {DNA} motif based on its Position Frequency Matrix ({PFM)} representation. The accuracy of the p-value approximation is shown by comparison with the simulated count distribution. Furthermore, we compare the approach with a binomial approximation, (compound) Poisson approximation, and a normal approximation. In general, our approach outperforms these approximations or is equally good but significantly faster. An implementation of our approach is available at http://mosta.molgen.mpg.de.},
