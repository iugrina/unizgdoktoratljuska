	abstract = {The main aim of this article is to determine the distribution of the number of palindromes of a fixed length in a {DNA} sequence. Palindrome in {DNA} is a part of the {DNA} sequence which is equal to its complementary sequence read backwards (C ∼ G, A ∼ T). We examine the general case where the distribution of the nucleobases is arbitrary. Further, we determine conditions in which Normal approximation can be used. Special attention is given to coding and non-coding regions in {DNA} and to the distribution of bases in those parts of {DNA.}},

	abstract = {Composite mature B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms are rare entities characterized by the simultaneous presence of two or more distinctive B-cell derived monoclonal malignancies. This retrospective study used multiparametric flow cytometric analysis aimed at immunophenotypic profiling of composite mature B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms in a cohort of 413 subsequent patients with de novo leukemic B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed in our institution during a 30-month period. Biclonality was found in 16 (3.9 \%) patients. The vast majority (88 \%) of the cases had one of the clones phenotypically corresponding to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ({CLL/SLL).} Only when composite cases were categorized by phenotype of the non-{CLL/SLL} malignant population did we find a statistically significant (P = 0.001) higher frequency of biclonality among cases with hairy cell leukemia (22 \%). Biclonal cases had the overall B-cell membrane κ to λ ratio within the normal range (median, 1.9; reference interval 0.5–4.0), making recognition of malignancy somewhat challenging. Our analysis strategy was therefore based on the detection of aberrant B-cell phenotypes, with subsequent confirmation of the monoclonal nature of neoplastic clones with regards to light chain restriction analysis. Discrimination of the coexisting clones in biclonal cases was possible on the basis of the expression of other antigen(s) (63 \%), light scatter properties (44 \%), different surface light chain restriction (69 \%) and/or pattern of expression (44 \%). The most informative cell surface antigens proved to be {CD22}, {CD20}, surface {IgM}, and {CD23.} In conclusion, historic κ/λ ratio is not a reliable approach and is a poor measurement for the detection of composite lymphomas. More creative analysis techniques should be utilized for this purpose.},
